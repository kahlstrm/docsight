# Contributing to DOCSight

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

If you need setup help, troubleshooting, or want to share a real-world DOCSight deployment, start with [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) so you end up in the right place first.

## Before You Start

**Please open an issue or start an Ideas discussion first** before working on any new feature or significant change. This lets us discuss the approach and make sure it fits the project architecture. PRs without prior discussion may be closed.

This is especially important for:
- New features or modules
- Architectural changes
- Changes touching multiple files

Small bugfixes and typo corrections are fine without an issue.

## Architecture

DOCSight v2.0 uses a **modular collector-based architecture**. All data collection follows this pattern:

```
Collector Registry → Base Collector (Fail-Safe) → Analyzer/Storage → Web UI
```

**When contributing:**
- New data sources must implement the `Collector` base class
- New modem types must implement the `ModemDriver` base class (`app/drivers/base.py`)
- Collectors run in **parallel threads** via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Protect shared state with locks.
- Use the collector pattern for automatic fail-safe and health monitoring
- Construct apps with `app.app_factory.create_app()`; internal consumers use `current_runtime()` and the language/time/theme/version owners in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). Community `app.web` accessors, mutations, `APP_VERSION`, and `require_auth` remain supported; importing it creates no app or app-specific globals.

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed technical documentation and data flow diagrams.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsDNNS/docsight.git
cd docsight
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --only-binary=:all: --require-hashes -r requirements-uv.txt
uv pip install --python python --compile-bytecode --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
uv pip install --python python --compile-bytecode --require-hashes -r requirements-test.txt
```

## Docker Development

For a containerized dev environment:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

This runs on port **8767** (`http://localhost:8767`) in demo mode. Production uses `docker-compose.yml` on port 8765.

## Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
npm ci
npm test
```

The Python suite covers analyzers, collectors, drivers, event detection, API endpoints, config, MQTT, i18n, and PDF generation. The zero-dependency JavaScript lane uses Node 22's built-in test runner for browser bootstrap and pure frontend contracts. Run both suites before submitting a PR.

### Browser E2E suite

Install the browser test dependencies before running this suite:

```bash
uv pip install --python python --compile-bytecode pytest-playwright==0.7.2 playwright==1.58.0
python -m playwright install chromium
```

The shard manifest assigns every `tests/e2e/test_*.py` file exactly once. Validate the manifest and collection denominator without launching a browser:

```bash
python scripts/e2e_shards.py validate
python -m pytest --collect-only -q tests/e2e
```

Run one shard, all four shards, one shard in reverse file order, or the canonical unsharded selection:

```bash
TZ=UTC python scripts/e2e_shards.py run --shard 1 -- -q --tb=short
for shard in 1 2 3 4; do TZ=UTC python scripts/e2e_shards.py run --shard "$shard" -- -q --tb=short || exit; done
TZ=UTC python scripts/e2e_shards.py run --shard 1 --reverse -- -q --tb=short
TZ=UTC python scripts/e2e_shards.py run --all -- -q --tb=short
```

The original canonical single-process command also remains available for rollback comparison:

```bash
TZ=UTC python -m pytest -q tests/e2e --tb=short
```

### Mobile viewport quality gate

For a focused mobile check after installing the browser test dependencies above:

```bash
TZ=UTC python -m pytest -q tests/e2e/test_mobile_quality_gate.py --tb=short
```

The gate checks a `393x852` viewport for overflow, off-screen controls, modal/footer overlap, console errors, and representative 44 px touch targets. Use the broader E2E suite when changing shared modal, navigation, chart, or journal behavior.

## Running Locally

```bash
python -m app.main
```

Open `http://localhost:8765` to access the setup wizard.

## Internationalization (i18n)

Translations live in `app/i18n/` as JSON files. The core interface has a 24-language European language pack; built-in modules keep `en.json` source catalogs and fall back to English unless a module explicitly ships its own locale file.

Each core locale file has a `_meta` field with `language_name` and `flag`. When adding or changing core UI strings, update **all existing core language files**. When adding or changing module UI strings, update the module's `en.json` source catalog and rely on English fallback unless the module intentionally owns a translated catalog.

### Adding a New Language

DOCSight is used internationally and translations from native speakers are welcome. To add a new core language:

1. Run `python scripts/i18n_check.py --generate` to create `app/i18n/template.json` locally from the current English source catalog.
2. Copy the generated file to `app/i18n/<lang>.json` (e.g. `sv.json` for Swedish, `nl.json` for Dutch). Use the ISO 639-1 two-letter code.
3. Fill in `_meta.language_name` (native spelling, e.g. `Svenska` not `Swedish`) and `_meta.flag` (emoji flag).
4. Translate the values. Keep the JSON keys untouched. Preserve any `{placeholder}` tokens in the strings.
5. Run `python scripts/i18n_check.py --validate` to make sure no keys are missing or extra compared to `en.json`.
6. Open a PR. Mention in the description whether you are able to keep the translation updated when new strings are added in the future.

We prefer new languages to be contributed by people who actually use the tool in that language, so the translation sounds natural and stays maintained over time. Partial translations are fine - missing keys fall back to English automatically.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **One PR per feature/fix.** Don't bundle unrelated changes.
- **Keep changes focused and minimal.** Smaller PRs are easier to review and more likely to be merged.
- **Follow the pipeline architecture.** New functionality must integrate into the existing data flow, not bypass it.
- Add tests for new functionality
- Maintain all existing language translations in `app/i18n/*.json` (run `python scripts/i18n_check.py --validate`)
- Run the full test suite before submitting a PR
- AI-generated bulk PRs without prior discussion will not be merged

## Building Modules

DOCSight supports community modules that extend functionality without modifying core code. Modules can add API endpoints, data collectors, settings panels, dashboard tabs, and more.

Route contributions export a Flask `Blueprint`; they must not call
`app.register_blueprint()`, `app.add_url_rule()`, or `Blueprint.register()`
themselves. Routes and decorators recorded on the exported blueprint are the
module contribution consumed by the registrar.
Deferred Blueprint record callbacks run once on an isolated application during
preflight and again during real registration. Community callbacks must
therefore be idempotent and free of filesystem, network, process, or other
external side effects.
The shared application registration contract preflights the complete core and
module plan before applying it. Endpoint names, blueprint names, route/method
pairs, module IDs, static mounts, and configuration ownership must therefore be
globally unique. Add registration-contract tests when changing this surface,
including a failure case that proves the target application and process-wide
catalogs remain unchanged.
Every explicitly declared contribution must resolve and validate during that
preflight. An unresolved route, static directory, template, catalog, class, or
JSON contribution rejects the module's complete plan; no partial contribution
is registered.

Modules declare dashboard content with `contributes.tab` and dialogs with
`contributes.dialogs`, each pointing to a module template such as
`templates/example_tab.html` or `templates/example_dialogs.html`. Empty rendered
tabs receive no view wrapper. Dialogs render outside hidden views, so an enabled
integration can keep its setup dialog available before it is configured. Missing
or unsafe dialog templates reject the complete module contribution plan.

The module static directory's `main.js` loads automatically, with a versioned URL,
on both Dashboard and Settings when the module is enabled. Top-level execution
must tolerate missing dashboard elements and globals. Expose an idempotent view
initialization hook (for example `window.initExampleView`) and wire it into the
existing dashboard routing convention. Guard absent view elements and ensure
repeated activation does not accumulate listeners, timers, or fetch loops.

Community modules must keep using the stable, supported `app.web` imports:
`require_auth`, `get_config_manager`, `get_storage`, `get_state`, and `get_module_loader`.
Built-in modules use `app.web_auth` for authentication policy. Runtime accessors
resolve the active application's runtime. Do not import or create a module-level Flask app or
cache app-derived storage or mutable request/runtime state in module globals.
Collectors receive their runtime-facing `web` object explicitly and must keep
working without a Flask application context.

### Browser URL contract

DOCSight may be mounted below a reverse-proxy path such as `/docsight`. Browser code in core and community modules must pass every app-owned root-relative URL through `window.docsightUrl(path)` at the point where it is used. This includes `fetch()` targets, constructed API URLs, generated `href`/`src` attributes, downloads, and internal navigation:

```javascript
fetch(docsightUrl('/api/example'));
image.src = docsightUrl('/api/example/image/' + id);
```

The helper is loaded before module scripts on DOCSight's standalone pages. It accepts only a safe internal string beginning with exactly one `/`, preserves query strings and fragments, and throws for relative, absolute, protocol-relative, traversal, malformed, or ambiguously encoded input. Modules should not catch that error and retry with an unprefixed URL.

Keep server-rendered Jinja URLs on `url_for()` or `module_static_url()`. External links, `blob:`/`data:` URLs, and current-document query/hash navigation do not use `docsightUrl()`. Do not patch browser globals such as `fetch` or `location`, and do not copy or infer the deployment prefix in module code.
